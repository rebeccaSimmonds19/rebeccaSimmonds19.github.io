# DevConf.cz 2018

I recently went to DevConf for the first time, this is an open source conference for like-minded developers and engineers.
I found it to be a very friendly and community driven experience.
The three days proved to have many interesting and thought provoking talks, two of which i will discuss in more detail in this blog post.
I was also lucky enough to participate in a demo booth, put together by my team to show case [radanalyticsio](https://radanalytics.io/).
This enabled me to talk to people from around the world, about a variety of topics and projects that were being investigated and developed.

## The Booth

At the conference my team (daikon) had a booth with a fast neural network demonstration.
This demonstration used the current image from the web camera and a pattern, which was chosen at random every five minutes.
The (brief) idea behind this, is that the last layer of the neural network is not trained and this is done by taking the image and training it using the pattern.
This results in the image from the camera being overlaid by the pattern in real-time. For a more in depth look into this please look at the Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

The booth allowed me to talk to a vast amount of friendly, clever community people which was very insightful. One person i spoke to is working on using ML to train security systems
to block attackers before they have even had a chance to do anything malicious by recognising patterns such as file transfers from unknown IPs.
What i find interesting about ML is the many different use cases that it can cover and the different industry sectors it can support. I hope to delve further into these techniques in
my own work and I am currently taking an ML course online with [udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262), which is completely free. If you are interested in
ML techniques and are totally new to the subject you should take a look.

I also spoke about the project I am currently working on: [radanalyticsio](https://radanalytics.io/). This project aims to enable ML techniques for people who have little or no training
in ML/AI techniques simply and easily. We hope to promote the development of intelligent applications by deploying maintainable and testable microservices through using container technology
on OpenShift. If you get the chance I would advise taking a look at the site as there are some great tutorials (which I have been through), which give a great insight into deploying
your own cloud native app, ML techniques and tools, as well as emerging technologies like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Keynote 1:

This was a nice keynote, which went through open source and the philosophy/idea behind it.
It pointed out these main points for open source to succeed:
**Collaboration** - generating ideas with others and collaborating on something you can't do on your own.
**Trust** - you need to trust that people want to move forward with the project.
**Diversity** - new and innovative ideas.

Also mentioned was the need for balance, open source repositories such as Github help to enable new open source projects very easily and promote innovation.
However, if people do not check what is out there then they can start to produce duplicate projects, which is not very helpful. Therefore, there needs to be a balance of
innovation and community collaboration. The challenge to this is standards, how can we use interfaces and APIs to reuse software and expand on the knowledge we all have collaboratively.

## Thoughts on AI

This talk asked the question "where are we going with AI?"" It spoke about automation and how this will change the road of human labour. Are we entering a new AI revolution like the
industrial revolution and what will it mean for peoples jobs?
I firmly believe AI will have a massive impact on the world today and it will have a great impact on supporting human labour and making the world a safer
place. From a developer perspective, it seems that the main impact will be on automation, security, monitoring and testing. This will enable
the developer more time for innovation and I think lead to a hybrid developer, which will be a mix of data scientist and computer scientist.

## Conclusion

I came away from this conference thinking:

1. If the development community are to truly achieve their potential open source and collaboration are essential, but need balance.
2. The idea of a hybrid developer to data scientist and vice versa is integral to new innovations.
3. AI/ML is going to change the way the world currently works and help to automate many tedious tasks so that new and innovative findings and research will be possible.

So all in all the tech scene is currently a **VERY** interesting place to be, with tones of fabulous new ideas and an explosion of growth in the data science sector.
I would advice anyone to get involved whether it be for work or for fun and to have a little look at our website or some free courses to help expand your knowledge in the area
-and hopefully you will find it as interesting and as exciting as I do!
