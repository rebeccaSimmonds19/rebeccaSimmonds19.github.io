# About Me:

Hi there! My name is Becky and I am  a senior software engineer at Red Hat.
Here I am part of an emerging technology group, which comprises of both data scientists and developers.
I completed a PhD at Newcastle University, England, UK, in which I developed a platform for scalable, geospatial and temporal analysis of Twitter data.
After this I moved to a small startup company as a Java developer creating solutions to improve performance for a CV analyser.
I have a keen interest in architecture design and data analysis, which I am furthering at Red Hat with Openshift and ML research.

I have started this blog to help discuss and spread my ideas and thoughts on the world of tech today.
I am a friendly, open source kind of gal and would love to connect to any like minded people. I am very passionate about helping more women into tech
so if you are looking for any advice or even a general overview of what it is like feel free to get in touch.
