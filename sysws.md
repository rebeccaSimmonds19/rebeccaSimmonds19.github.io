# My Tips for Talks

After not presenting in front of anyone for over 6 months, having to speak in front of 50 people with a 10 foot screen was, let’s say, a little daunting. I could feel my hands shake and my heart beat faster as I got up to speak. However after I stood up and started to go through my slides I felt at ease. This was a topic I was confident and passionate about - I could do this! As a piece of advice or a pondering (which I had always thought was right), no matter how confident you are actually getting up and practising talks is the only way to get better at them. I can remember when I first started speaking at conferences I used to hate it. I used to fret about it for days before and go over every little detail afterwards, thinking about every mistake wishing I could take it back. However this is not the way to give a good talk so here are my tips for a good talk:

## 1) Be comfortable and know the topic:

There is nothing worse than having to talk about someone else's slides or having to rush together a talk where you don't have a story or a clue about the conclusion/point you want to get across. Finding a story you want to talk about and put across to the audience is the most important thing. Sometimes it is easier to start with the concluding points and build around that. Remember your talk should have a start, middle and an end.

## 2) Practice when you can:

You should always aim to have at least one run through in front of other people before a talk, this will help you gauge the slides/story you have and get an idea of what you could change. I say could because you are the author of the slides and you always know best but, taking on feedback and being flexible and open to changing the slides is a must.

## 3) Check the time allowance:

ALWAYS check the time allowance you have and make sure you can run to that. There is nothing worse than when people over run and miss out some of the most interesting stuff in their talk! If you can have a timer on your laptop/watch that is a great idea, so that you can tell whether you are on time or going over.

## 4) Cheat:

I always bring some water up to the stage, this means if I get a dry mouth OR even if I panic I have time and a natural way of taking a break. There is nothing worse than trying to give a talk with a dry mouth! Also if you blank on your slides or have a panic you can get a drink of water and have a few seconds break without the audience knowing what is going on - you still look professional.

## 5) Everyone is different:

Everyone has a different way of presenting and a different way of telling a story, so ultimately only you can help yourself do a good talk.

**Disclaimer**: I am by no means an expert at talking and everyone is different so take my tips in a way that they can help you :)
