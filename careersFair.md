# Newcastle University Careers Day from PhD to Industry

I was invited to a careers afternoon at Newcastle University. 
This was aimed at helping PhD students to understand how to move into industry and if this was the correct move for them.
I was invited as an alumnus of Newcastle University, and having done a PhD and then moved to industry it made sense me being part of the day.

The day started with a set of panels I sat on the SAGE (science, agriculture and engineering) panel. 
Here we spoke about our experience in industry to date and what we have done.
There were some inspirational people there who have moved in and out of industry and academia. 
The panel had a range of ages, careers and experience. Here is an example of a question asked at the panel 

_how different was industry to academia?_

My answer was as follows: 

_Within Red Hat I have had the opportunity to continue researching, 
so the change was not great. They also have a philosophy of trust, so you can remote work and the onus is on you to get the work done,
similar to the PhD. Other companies I have worked for it was _very_ different they had strict 9-5 hours and spreadsheets to track your time.
I found this off putting. It cultured the idea that as long as you were in the office you were working which is not great incentive.
However, working on your own terms when you have your own work to do is very satisfying. So it is very important to get the right 
culture for yourself, therefore, have a think about this before applying to jobs._

The second half of the day was a round table. This involved choosing question cards and discussing the answers.
This involved discussions between students and mentors. It gave an interesting insight into how the PhD students need help for
future career decisions. One of the top questions was how to get a job with no experience. I answered this by telling them a PhD is experience
and you need to match it to the job requirements of the job you are applying for. It is important to know you are valuable
as an employee and make sure you have confidence in that and what you can do.

This day was a great motivator to help the community with careers. 
It was also an eye opener to how Newcastle Red Hat needs more transparency
and visibility. A few good ideas to help this and recruitment would be: 
* open days at the university
* a newsletter
* getting involved in the Red Hat Academy
* using ties and relationships with university to publicise the great work we do.

I hope to continue work on this and create a better community with the university.
