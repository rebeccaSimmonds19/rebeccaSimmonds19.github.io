# Turing Institute day - how open source can help acedemia

This was a workshop to help acedemia use and take advantage of open source.The day began with a talk on how to build sucessful open source communities. 
They showed the problems and the potential downside of opensource to give a realistic and helpful insight:
* time
* relinquish some kind of control
* lack of acedmic credit
* publicity skills?
* chance of sucess is low

Why you should use open source:

* increased speed, reach and impact
* increased life span of the project
* increased career potential
* profit 

How: model, code, _documentation_, communications and publicity

Microsoft and how they use open source: 

This was a dramatic turn around in 2010's. Shows the increased interest in open source and how it is being embraced. 
Community, feature development and application direction can be gained from these communities.
Food for though: 
* Will they open source Windows?
* Wil it move to the Linux kernel?

The legal licensing of open source was discussed. The different license types and how they should be OSI 
compliant otherwise you need to be really careful and look into how they are used. This involved a lot of discussion and 
help for people not sure on the intricacies of licensing and how your code can be used by others. 
If you choose open source code and then change it you can make your additions closed source but the open source part will always be open source unless changed.

In the afternoon Rui and I's talk was up this was about sucessful open source communities and we covered an open source
project close to our hearts (rad.io)[radanalytics.io] - feel free to check out this cool project. It has a project oshinko which 
allows Apache Spark to be deployed on openshift. The rad.io site has many interesting and fun tutorials to take part in and
the community love to have passionate people to help support and carry on the good work of this project.

This day was an inspirig day full of insight into open source and how it can help anyone! :)
