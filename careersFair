# Newcastle University Careers Day for PhD to Industry

I was invited to a careers afternoon at Newcastle University. 
This was aimed at helping PhD students to understand how to move into indutry and if this was the correct move for them.
I was invited as an alumni of Newcastle University, and having done a PhD and then moved to industry it made sense me being part of the day.

The day started with a set of panels I sat on the SAGE (science, agriculture and engineering) panel. 
Here we spoke about our experience in industry to date and what we have done.
There were some inspirational people there who have moved in and out of industry and acedemia.
